* quote data identified!!
* research question "what sets these apart from normal speech?"
* these quotes represent the positive class only
* where can we get negatives, when the original full interview transcript is unavailable
* "lanchart" spoken language corpus, danish

 

* need to convert sentences to vectors (with e.g. 100 dimensions)
* use multilingual bert for this
* start with huggingface and pytorch architecture
* positive data from Lasse's quotes. Negative data from .. elsewhere (lanchart, wikipedia, ...)
* build a classifier e.g. SVM, using random samples as negative examples and quotes as positive examples
* train on held-out data; how do we do?
* BERT intro scripts to be made available
